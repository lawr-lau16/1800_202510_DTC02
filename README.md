# ParkPal

## Overview
ParkPal is a full-stack web application designed to solve the common urban challenge of finding convenient and safe parking spots. Drivers often struggle with unreliable information, difficulty navigating to available spots, and uncertainty about safety. ParkPal addresses these issues with an interactive, user-friendly parking map interface that displays verified spots, reviews, and directions.

This app was developed as part of the BCIT CST Program to demonstrate real-world application of REST APIs, Firebase, Firestore, Mapbox, JavaScript, and responsive design principles. ParkPal is built with the mindset: *"By drivers, for drivers."*

## Limitations and Future Work

### Limitations
- Private parking data is only visible to the creator.
- Currently supports manual parking pin creation only.
- Limited sorting and filtering options in reviews.

### Future Work
- Implement real-time spot availability using IoT/GPS data.
- Add filtering by price, hours, and accessibility.
- Integrate user-based trust ratings for reviews.
- Add dark mode and voice command support.
